Neural Network from Scratch in Python

Do you really think that a neural network is a block box? I believe, a neuron inside the human brain may be very complex, but a neuron in a neural network is certainly not that complex. In this article, we are going to discuss how to implement a neural network from scratch in Python. This means we are NOT going to use deep learning libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, etc.
